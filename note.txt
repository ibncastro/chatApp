REAL TIME WEB APPS WITH SOCKET.IO

- socket.io enables two-way communication btn the server and client.
- its library built upon node.js's native websocket.

- use path.join() to move btn directories instead of using __dirname + /../public/

- Some built in events u can listen to is "connect" and "disconnect".
- use socket.on to register a listener.
- we can send and recieve anything from server and client using custom events.
- normally the data exchanged btn the client and server are objects with properties.
- io.on or io.emit is very special , we normally dont attach anything to it or make calls to it other than what we have done. which is connect and disconnect

- Broadcasting is a term for emiting an event to all but one specific user.
- socket.Broadcast will broadcast message to the rest except the mentioned socket.
- it is an object that has its own emit function.
